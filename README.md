# Unique Flow
A WebGL Generative Artwork

This animation is used as an installation runnig on 2x4K UHD displays at the 2016 Geneva Car Show using a [NVIDIA Shield](https://shield.nvidia.co.uk/android-tv)

Also Google Cast enabled with a sufficiently [powerful](https://shield.nvidia.co.uk/android-tv) device. Try running from chrome with the [Google Cast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-cast/boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd?hl=en) extension installed.

*Warning*: It is not recommended to run this against a regular Chromecast. Although these are WebGL enabled, they are, as you might expect, very underpowered.
